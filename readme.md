This package contains an implementation of Intelligent Trial and Error, inspired by [the original pyite package developed by JB Mouret and his lab](https://github.com/resibots/pyite).

This package plays especially well with archives built using [pymelites](https://github.com/miguelgondu/pymelites). Check `./example` to see how a rastrigin archive computed with pymelites can be used as a prior for learning (and optimizing) another function.
